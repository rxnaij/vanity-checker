      <h1>About this silly project</h1>
      <div class="wrapper">
        <div>
          <h2>What is this thing, anyway?</h2>
          <p>We all know deep down that we're all absolutely engrossed with ourselves, especially in a world of selfies and likes. Admitting it, however, is a different story. The <strong>Vanity Checker</strong> uses cutting-edge technology to deliver an assessment of your narcissism quotient straight to your browser. Just pop in a written piece of yours and the Vanity Checker will psychoanalyze it better than a college freshman's first paper on Freud.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>The Vanity Checker calculates the ratio of self-pronouns (such as "I", "me", and "my") to other sentences in the text. This is a simple and completely unscientific way of estimating how often the author feels the need to reference their own self to communicate a point.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>What the heck is the point?</h2>
          <p>Glad you asked. The author of this application has found that when writing about himself, he drizzles sentences with self-pronouns in a predictable and inelegant fashion, like an absentminded cook adding too much salt. Feeling self-conscious about his self-consciousness, he devised ways to reduce the surplus of self-pronouns in his writing, for instance, writing this completely necessary application.</p>
